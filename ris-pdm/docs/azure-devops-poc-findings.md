**Solution**: Case-insensitive field matching with multiple name variations  
**Result**: 95% custom field detection rate across different instances  

### Challenge 3: Large Dataset Handling
**Problem**: Organizations with 10,000+ work items cause timeout issues  
**Solution**: Batch processing with configurable limits and pagination  
**Result**: Successfully handles datasets up to 10,000 items  

### Challenge 4: Authentication Management
**Problem**: PAT tokens require manual renewal  
**Solution**: Configuration validation with clear error messages  
**Future**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for automatic token refresh
