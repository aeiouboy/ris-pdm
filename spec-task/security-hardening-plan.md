  test('should block auth requests after 5 attempts', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
  
  test('should allow requests after window expires', async () => {
    // Test implementation  
  })
})

// Input validation tests
describe('Input Validation', () => {
  test('should reject malicious SQL injection attempts', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
  
  test('should sanitize XSS attempts', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
})
```

#### Integration Tests
- Rate limiting across multiple endpoints

- **Code Coverage**: 95% coverage for security-related code paths

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency Impact**: <5ms additional latency from security measures
- **Throughput**: No degradation in requests/second capacity
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB additional memory footprint
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% false positives from security measures

### Monitoring & Logging

// Security event logging
const securityEvents = {
  RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: 'Rate limit exceeded for IP',
  INVALID_AUTH_ATTEMPT: 'Invalid authentication attempt',
  MALICIOUS_INPUT_DETECTED: 'Malicious input pattern detected',
  WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_INVALID: 'Invalid webhook signature'
}
```

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Rate limiting causes performance degradation | High | Medium | Performance testing, Redis optimization |
| Input validation breaks existing clients | High | Low | Backward compatibility testing |
| Security headers break UI functionality | Medium | Medium | Staged rollout, CSP nonce implementation |
